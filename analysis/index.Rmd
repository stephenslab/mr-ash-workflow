### MR.ASH vs penalized linear regression

This is for MR.ASH vs. penalized linear regression.

Our story is 

(1) the MR.ASH's shrinkage operator (from a normal mixture prior) is more flexible than other popular shrinkage operators,
which is a parametric form of $\lambda$ (and $\gamma$ if exists).

(2) VEB can do better than cross validation.

#### Performance of methods -- Ridge case

#### Flexibility of convex/non-convex shrinkage operators (E-NET, SCAD, MCP, L0Learn) vs MR.ASH shrinkage operator.

[Result 2](Result2_Nonconvex.html)

### MR.ASH vs. all other methods.

This is to reproduce the results in the Experiment section.
Throughout the studies, we will fix $n = 500$.

The default setting is

(1) The number of coefficients $p = 2000$

(2) The number of nonzero coefficients $s = 20$ (sparsity)

(3) Design: IndepGauss

(4) Signal shape for nonzero coefficients: SparseNormal

(5) PVE: 0.5

(6) Update order: `increasing` or `1:p`

(7) Initialization: `null` or a vector of zeros.

We will change exactly one of the below and fix the rest.

$p$

Sparsity

Design

PVE

The results will be provided below.

### $p$

IndepGauss + SparseNormal, $n = 500$, $p = 50, 500, 5000, 50000$ and $s = 20$.

### Sparsity

IndepGauss + SparseNormal, $n = 500$, $p = 2000$ and $s = 1,5,20,100,500,2000$.
